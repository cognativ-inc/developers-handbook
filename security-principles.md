# Secure System Engineering Principles

The purpose of this guideline is to establish a set of principles for engineering secure systems. These principles provide a foundation for developing and maintaining robust and secure software systems. By following these principles, software developers can contribute to the overall security and reliability of the systems they build.

## Principle of Defense in Depth

The principle of defense in depth emphasizes the implementation of multiple layers of security controls to protect information systems. This includes incorporating security measures at various levels such as: 

### Physical

Physical access controls: Implementing measures such as locks, access cards, biometric authentication, and security guards to restrict access to physical infrastructure and sensitive areas.

### Network Layer

Firewalls: Installing network firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against network-based attacks.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Implementing IDPS solutions that monitor network traffic, detect and respond to potential intrusion attempts or suspicious activities.

### Operating System Layer

Secure configurations: Ensuring that operating systems are configured securely by disabling unnecessary services, applying security patches and updates, and enabling appropriate security features.

Access controls: Implementing user access controls, strong authentication mechanisms, and privilege management to restrict user privileges and prevent unauthorized access to system resources.

### Application Layer

Secure coding practices: Following secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.

Input validation: Implementing input validation techniques to ensure that user-supplied data is properly validated and sanitized to prevent data breaches or code execution vulnerabilities.

### Data Layer

Encryption: Implementing encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

Data backup and recovery: Regularly backing up critical data and implementing robust data recovery mechanisms to mitigate the impact of data loss or corruption.

## Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege states that users, processes, and systems should be given the minimum level of access necessary to perform their required functions. This principle helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential misuse of system resources.


## Principle of Secure by Design

The principle of secure by design emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations from the early stages of the system development life cycle. Security should not be an afterthought but an integral part of the system design.

## Principle of Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

The principle of continuous monitoring and improvement advocates for ongoing monitoring, analysis, and enhancement of the system's security posture. This includes regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security incident monitoring. 

## Principle of Secure Coding Practices

The principle of secure coding practices emphasizes the importance of following secure coding guidelines and best practices. This includes validating input data, sanitizing user inputs, avoiding common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and buffer overflows, and using secure coding techniques.

## Principle of Secure Configuration Management

The principle of secure configuration management highlights the significance of securely configuring hardware, software, and network components. This includes applying security patches and updates, disabling unnecessary services, configuring access controls, and using strong and unique passwords.
